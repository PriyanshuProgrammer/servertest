It's far from fancy, but it is relatively clean slate to build on. Feel free to clone this repo or use the Deploy button below to use this code as a starting point for your own project!

The [example deployment](https://express-vercel-woad.vercel.app/) uses the `Other` [Framework Preset](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/configure-a-build#framework-preset) for Build and Development Settings. No overrides are needed.
